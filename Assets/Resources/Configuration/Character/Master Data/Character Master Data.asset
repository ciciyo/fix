    name: Kyra
    description: His family lived in the Citadel when Terra attacked their planet,
      Nolea. Believing that his entire family was killed, leaving him as the sole
      survivor, he was taken to a rebel camp at a young age, joining other orphans
      who had lost their parents to the war. As he grew older, he decided to join
      the fight to avenge his family. Now, he leads an elite strike force for the
      rebel forces known as the "Reckoners."

      Ajax is a legendary assassin and one of the most feared assets among Terra\u2019s
      troops."
